# 🏏 IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (2008–2020)

This repository contains a **simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Indian Premier League (IPL) data from **2008 to 2020**. It aims to uncover key insights about teams, players, venues, and match outcomes.

## 📂 Dataset
We used two datasets:
- `IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv` – match-level information (match id, teams, venue, winner, toss info, etc.)
- `IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv` – ball-by-ball deliveries (batsman, bowler, runs, extras, wickets, etc.)

## 📝 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the IPL data
- Explore match-level statistics:
  - Most successful teams across seasons
  - Team performance at different venues
  - Toss decisions and match outcomes
- Explore player-level statistics:
  - Top run scorers, wicket-takers
  - Player of the Match analysis
- Visualize insights with bar charts, pie charts, and line plots

## 📊 Visualizations
Some of the visual insights produced include:
- **Wins per team per season**
- **Top venues by number of matches played**
- **Impact of toss decisions on match outcomes**
- **Most runs/wickets by players**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Outcome
This simple EDA provides a clear overview of IPL trends, highlights top-performing teams and players, and shows interesting tournament patterns. It also serves as a starting point for deeper predictive analytics, such as winner prediction or player performance forecasting.
